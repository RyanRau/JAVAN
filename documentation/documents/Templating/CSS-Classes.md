# CSS Classes

The base template has all the required CSS and JS to use bootstrap 4. 

Some helpful resources for bootstrap:

- [W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap4/)
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/getting-started/introduction/)

I've also made some custom classes mainly to match the coloring scheme

```html
<button class="btn btn-red">
    Red Button       
</button>

<button class="btn btn-grey">
    Grey Button       
</button>
```

Most other css is all done within the html. Typically, the only css I've used is for offsetting elements, for the
most part I use bootstrap classes for everything. The few css classes I have made have been for things that needed to 
be done time and time again.
